## Concept

We created a wireframe,that includes where our components in the responsive app will find a place, and then drawn the sketch.
The concept sketch, was one of our initial steps in our brainstorming process of creating this app.
The reason behind creating a concept sketch,was because we wanted to visualize the project together from the start,
which helped our team to shape/share our ideas, and to get a clear idea of what kind of design we will go for. 
Because of that, we created a quick and simple way to clarify our ideas and keep the project moving forward. <br/>

## Development methodologies

* Use of a Kanban Board <br/>
The purpose of Kanban is to create continuous change and improvements.Kanban is used to discuss
process and make suggestions for improvements.
By using the Kanban Board, we have made a preparation for the upcoming work during this project. 
Since this is a digital group project, and we were not able to meet in person due to COVID-19, we found
that the best way to create a Kanban Board will be using an online tool. Because of that, we choose
to use Trello, which is a collaboration tool that organizes projects into boards.
By using the Kanban Board, we did have an overview on what's we have been working on,who's working on what,
and the work process/progress. Once we were done with the given task, we gave the status to the task as "completed", and 
all of the tasks have been assigned their own deadline.

<a name="prototype"></a>
## Prototype

* An interactive mockup of our web design.
* High-fidelity visual version of the app,that allows you to link between pages.<br/>
* [Prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d473a8d5-681e-4022-612c-0780508b4732-a242/?fullscreen) shows how the plan was that our app would work/look like before we build it up.

There is also possibility to use SSH instead of https. 
The steps for cloning the project by use of SHH are to open the Intellij and select **"Check out from Version Control**, select **GIT**.
Once **Git** is selected, paste the Git repository URL, and select the directory where you want to clone it into.
You will be asked if you want to connect to Github, and you should click yes.
Now, intelliJ will tell you that there is an Unlinked project,so click on import Gradle project;use the auto-import and unselect the "create Separate module per source set"-then ok.
The next step is to right-click the project,and open Module settings,select SDK's, and there you have to select the JDK that is installed on your system and click ok; and the project is installed and ready to run.
You are also able to use WebStorm. You have to specify the URL of the project [Github](https://github.com/Westerdals/pro104-eksamen-gruppe-11) <br/>, enter the path to the folder where your
local Git repository will be created,and click Clone.WebStorm will automatically set Git root mapping to the project root directory.
